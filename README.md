## UX

### 5 Planes of UX

Why?
The business objective is to drive rental income for my father's holiday rental property.

Who For?
Holiday makers looking for a holiday rental on the Limestone Coast of South Australia.

Why people are willing to use it?
Holiday makers want to make informed decision about their holiday rental.

Why they need it?
To allow them to learn more about the property and to make a booking if interested.
