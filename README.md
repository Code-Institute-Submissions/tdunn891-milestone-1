# Milestone Project 1 - Addie McGinty's Cottage

This project aims ultimately to increase holiday rentals of my family's beachhouse in Robe, South Australia.

## UX

### 5 Planes of UX   
<!-- https://medium.com/omarelgabrys-blog/ux-a-quick-glance-about-the-5-elements-of-user-experience-part-2-a0da8798cd52 -->
#### Strategy
<!-- The reason for the product, application or the site, why we create it, who are we doing this for, why people are willing to use it, why they need it. The goal here is to define the user needs and business objectives. -->

Why?
The business objective for the website is to increase rental income from our family's holiday rental property. Over the previous 10 years, the house has yielding very low rental income, with only several tenants per year. The tourism sector in Robe is on the rise (annual domestic vistor nights increasing 7%), which makes this a prime opportunity for this site to capture this expanding holiday rental market. The house's existing Google Maps listing will be populated with a link to this site.

Who For?
The site is aimed at holiday makers looking for a holiday rental on coast of South Australia.

Why people are willing to use it?
Holiday makers want to make informed decision about their holiday rental.

Why they need it?
Potential tenants need to learn more about the property before they can make a booking.

#### Scope
<!-- Defines the functional and content requirements. What are the features, and content contained in the application or product. The requirements should fulfill and be aligned with the strategic goals. -->

##### Functional Specifications

In considering the functional specifications, I analyzed the key functions of successful holiday rental websites, including AirBNB, Booking.com, Trivago. I found the below features essential.

Feature Set:

- see the amenities of the house.
- locate the property on a map.
- see the sleeping capacity and room configuration.
- see the nightly rate.
- make a booking.
- see reviews from past holiday tenants.
- be directed to relevant social links.
- make an enquiry for further information.

##### Content Requirements
<!-- What is required to provide value? -->

In order to provide the value of the above functions, the following content is required:

- Images of the interior and exterior of the property.
- Embedded Google Map showing the property location and surrounding area.
- Icons (Font Awesome, Material Icons) to visually aide the user.
- User Form to allow enquiries.
- Text for previous tenant reviews and property description.
- Button to allow bookings to be made. The button directs the user to the real booking site: www.bookrobeaccommodation.com.au/accommodation/3

#### Structure
<!-- Defines how user interact with the product, how system behave when user interact, how itâ€™s organized, prioritized, and how much of it.  -->

##### Interaction Design
<!-- Patterns and sequences that provide options to the user -->
<!-- Good Int. Design:
helps people to accomplish their goals.
effectively communicates interactivity and functionality(what user can do).
informs user about state changes(file has been saved, or any feedback), while they interact.
prevents user error or mistakes, like the system asks user to confirm potentially harmful action(i.e. deletion). -->

Given the basic, informational nature of the site, a linear and predictable structure is most appropriate. The content is all on one continuous page to encourage particularly mobile-users to view all of the content easily without having to tap/click around i.e. to prevent cognitive overload.
A navigation bar is provided (which collapses into a toggler) to allow the user to quickly jump to a specific section.
The call to action is the 'MAKE BOOKING' button in the navigation bar.

Feedback:

- Navigation and social links change colour on hover, which encourages the user to click.
- Enquiry user form requires that all fields (Name, Email, Enquiry) are populated and alerts the user to any fields which require attention e.g. an email address without a '@'. Once the submit button is clicked, a modal is shown to provide feedback to the user that their enquiry was sent successfully

Consistency & Predictability:

- Users of holiday rental sites have been extrememly accustomed to following appropriate visual icons/cues to guide them. Icons have been employed consistent with those used in other booking sites to take advantage of this. Icons such as Bedroom, TW, Wifi, GPS Pin for location etc.
- Web and mobile users are accustomed to a top navbar who's items collapse into a 'burger icon' on mobile devices.


##### Information Architecture
<!-- Organisation, arrangement and priority of content -->
<!-- Given the content requirements, It defines the arrangement of content elements, how they are organized, to facilitate human understanding. -->
<!-- Good Info. Arch:
organizes, categorizes, and prioritizes the information based on user needs and business objectives.
makes it easy to understand and move through information presented.
flexible to accommodate growth and adapt to change.
appropriate for the audience. -->

Due to the low complexity and small amount of content, the architecture employed is single page, as well as several links to external websites (social links, booking website).

The organising principle of the content is tied to the user needs - Property Features, Explore, Reviews, Contact. 

The first feature a user wants to see is images and features of the house itself.

#### Skeleton
<!-- Interface Design: The best arrangement and visual presentation of elements 
Navigation Design: Intuitive and completion of tasks  -->
<!-- Concered with What form will application take, how will users get around how will we present the content? -->
<!-- WIREFRAMES -->


#### Surface

Colours
The shade of blue was chosen as the dominant colour to convey a relaxed, sea-side feel.

### User Stories
User 1 - "I want to take my family of 5, and elderly parents and dog to a beach holiday in Robe.
It needs to have ample living space, be close to the town's main street and be dog-friendly."
User 2 - "I have a large boat trailer, will there be adequate parking?"
User 3 - "I will be arriving quite late, what are the check-in times?"
